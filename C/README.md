##C

1. All the programs existing in this C folder were compiled and executed using **Code::Blocks**

2. In case you want to execute these programs on **Turbo C Compiler**, do the following:

	* Uncomment `#include<conio.h>` line.
	* Uncomment `clrscr()` and `getch()`.
	* Change the return type of `main()` from `int` to `void`.
